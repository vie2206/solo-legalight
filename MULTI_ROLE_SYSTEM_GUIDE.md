SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Application
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
NODE_ENV=development

# AI Integration (Optional)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

### Database Setup

1. **Run the Enhanced Schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the SQL file in Supabase SQL Editor
   /backend/sql/enhanced_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Tables Created**:
   - reading_passages
   - vocabulary_words
   - gk_questions
   - challenges
   - user_progress
